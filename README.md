# Hello
## I am Ruobing Shang.

I am a software developer currently based in Suzhou. Concurrently, I am pursuing a master's degree in artificial intelligence. My research domain is Natural Language Processing (NLP), including Question-Answering, Knowledge Graph and Large Language Model (LLM).

I’m currently studying algorithms, AI and full stack development. I’m good at Python, Java and Typescript. I create websites with Vue.js and TypeScript, and develop backend systems with Spring and Java. Moreover, I use Python to complete my research projects and make some convenient scripts.
